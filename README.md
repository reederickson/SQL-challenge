# SQL-challenge
Another very fun challenge! I was able to complete this assigment using the lecutures and my notes taken during said lectures. I ran my queries at the bottom of the table schemata.sql file (for continuity) but was able to seperate them into two files; the queries can be found under the EmployeeSQL.sql and the Quickdbd diagram/ table setup is found under the file with the same name. I have also included a .png image of the QuickDBD diagram.
